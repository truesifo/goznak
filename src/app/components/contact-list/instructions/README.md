# Contact List Grid Challenge

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will be required to take an array of contacts and present them in a visual, responsive grid. **Accuracy is key in this challenge. You are expected to fully replicate the provided spec as given!** The visual portion of this challenge can be accomplished entirely in CSS. Additionally, you are free to create additional components as you see fit.

You are given an empty `contact-list` component, and a JSON representation of a list of contacts which can be found in `contacts.ts`.
The spec and responsiveness example can be found at `spec.png` and `responsiveness.gif` in this folder respectively.
